This assignment gave an insight to derivatives and error related to them.

From question 1-3 we learned how derivatives move with respect to the actual plot what is the error when we take high values of h and x and finding the theoritical errors as well.

From question 4 and 5 we leaned about implementing trapezoid area finder and how it converges with increasing the number of trapeziums and leaned about various techniques of finding it and how they converge

From question 6 and 7 we extended polynomial class and finded the area and differentiation in the polynomial and also tested it by taylor series expansion for ex.sinx which was converging after more terms were included
