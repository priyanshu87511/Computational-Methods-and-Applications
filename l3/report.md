This assignment gave the clear understanding of jacobi and gauss siedel method along with the methods to solve linear equations and helped them learn the things by code

Question 1 helps to learn the implementation of list in python as the class rowvectorfloat was very similar to it

Question 2 helps us to give insight into jacobi and gauss siedel methods and also included things like DRDominant and sampling of the matrix.

Question 3 helps visualise the two convergence and I took logarithmic functions in e to plot them

Question 4 is a huge insight in polynomial classes how they can be implemented by overloading plus and multiply operators. Moreover, we saw how to plot the graphs and solve the equations using lagrange method and matrix method

Question 5 helped us learn about animation through python and various interpolation techniques which were quite well to see converging
