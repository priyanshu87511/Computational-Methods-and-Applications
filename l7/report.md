From this assignment from q1 and q2 we learnt to solve pde and how to animate them using imshow and see the results it was also known that the value of k/h**2 should be less than 1/2 and when it exceeds the limit the overflow occurs.

From q3 we found that from binary search how can we find nth root of a number within a given error

From q4 and q5 we saw the convergence properties of secant and newton raphson and how they work and it was plotted that convergence differnce is there

From q6 and q7 we saw the application of aberth method and saw how that works to find roots and approximate them.
