All questions on the whole gave a little brushup to the skills of python. I got to know the usage of matplotlib and random libraries. Got some insight on lists, tuples and dictionaries.

Specifying question 1, it showed the power of stirling approximation and I learned about this new way of approximating factorial and implementation helped me to believe the result and motivated to follow stirling approximation wherever needed.

Question number 2, made me learn about implementation of class in python and how randomising the values can be related to probability distribution of the dice.

Question number 3, helped me to understand that there can be various methods that are there to get the value of pi upto many decimal places and Monte Carlo method is one of the good methods to do so and plotting the graph showed how well it matches with the value of maths pi

Question 4 gave insights on classes, tuples, dictionary. How to use them what are their methods for finding key or values and many other things. There was also a case where we can get stuck if we kept on giving random words and that is mentioned in the program. Text was also fun reading ;)

Overall, this was a good beginning that helped me to learn python even better and prepare me for further assignments.
