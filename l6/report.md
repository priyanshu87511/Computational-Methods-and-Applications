From q1 and q2 we learned about how to implement forward eular and backward eular and plot the graphs and how it varies by changing the hvalues.

From q3, 4, 5 we leaned about the applications of eular methods how it can be used to see the pendulum problem, limit cycle and three body problem.
After plotting them all, results were quite matching than what they should be in actual.
