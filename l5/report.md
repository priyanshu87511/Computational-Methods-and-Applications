From this coding assignment we learned about legendre and chebyshev polynomials and also best fit functions

from question 1 we learned about the best fitting function with any dimension greater than 0 and fitting any number of points through it

from question 2 we found the correctness of the question 1. Polynomial that is given to us is converted to the expected dimension

from question 3 and 4 we leaned about legendre polynimials how to implement them and get nth legendre polynomial and how it matches good with increase in dimension for any function like e^x

from question 5 and 6 we leaned about chebyshev and nth chebychev and how it shows the orthogonal property

from question 7 we got an insight into fourier and how to approximate it to any function

from question 8 we got to multiply two numbers by only the complexity of nlogn
