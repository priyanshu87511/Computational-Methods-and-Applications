This assignment gave us an insight upon graphs and network x. Implementation of bfs and libraries of network x were fun and learning.

Question 1 and question 2 included overloading operators and finding the node degrees and plotting them which gave a flavour of graphs, matplotlib and functions.

Question 3 and 4 had a flavour of bfs in that and also the ER graph proves were easy to understand after the implementation by ou own. In question 4 I took the threshold as if more than 999 nodes are there in the highest connected component as it was not there in the question.

Question 5 had application of network x which included study of the functions associated with it and after all the bfs incoming in that also was quite interesting to solve. As an ambiguity to the largest shortest path I took the path which has the deepest going height with the shortest length.

Question 6 was the extension of question 5 as just by the bfs implementation we can find the correctness of the statement given in the question.
